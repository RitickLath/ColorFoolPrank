## Content Script - The Magic Behind the Prank

ColorFool-Prank's magic lies within the content script. This script is responsible for injecting colorful pranks into the websites you visit. The content script leverages the power of JavaScript to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) of web pages, allowing it to change the background color dynamically.

The content script continuously alters the background color of websites, creating a fun and surprising experience as you navigate different web pages. It showcases how JavaScript can interact with and modify the structure and style of web content, all in the name of good-natured fun!
